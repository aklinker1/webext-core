## Overview

An in-memory implementation of [`webextension-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webextension-polyfill) for testing. Supports all test frameworks (Vitest, Jest, etc).

```ts
pnpm i -D @webext-core/fake-browser
```

> This package only really works with projects using node, so only the NPM install steps are shown.

See [Testing Frameworks](/guide/fake-browser/testing-frameworks) to setup mocks for your testing framework of choice.

## Examples

See [Implemented APIs](/guide/fake-browser/implemented-apis) for example tests and details on how to use each API.
