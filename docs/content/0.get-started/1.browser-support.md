description: What browsers do WebExt Core's packages support? All of them.
---

## Overview

The `@webext-core` packages are simple wrappers around [`webextension-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webextension-polyfill) by Mozilla. As such, they will work on:

| Browser               | Supported Versions |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Chrome                | >= 87              |
| Firefox               | >= 78              |
| Safari <sup>_1_</sup> | >= 14              |
| Edge                  | >= 88              |

Other Chromium-based browsers are not officially supported, and may not work<sup>_2_</sup>. See Mozilla's [supported browsers documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill#supported-browsers) for more details.

> _<sup>1</sup>_ `webextension-polyfill` works on Safari, however Safari does not implement the complete web extension standard. See the [browser compatiblity chart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs) for more details.
>
> _<sup>2</sup>_ In practice, the browsers are close enough to chrome that they work 99% of the time. But make sure to test your extension before assuming it will work.
