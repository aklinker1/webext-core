## Project Goals

The goal of `webext-core` is to create useful, targetted, quality utilities for creating and publishing web extensions. Not just _Chrome_ extensions, but web extensions that work on all browsers, for all manifest versions.

With that in mind, there's a couple of expectations I have around new code:

- Code is written in TypeScript and packages provide great TypeScript support.
- Utilities support all browsers.
- Well unit tested. I won't require 100% coverage, but it should be close.

## Before You Contribute

If you're just fixing a bug or improving the docs, feel free to open a PR, no questions asked!

If you want to add a new package or feature, open an issue first. That way we can collaborate and make sure it fits the purpose listed in the [project goals](#project-goals). If you open a PR, but it's not something I want to maintain or it doesn't fit this project, you will have wasted your time. We both have lives to live :smiley:.

## Development Setup

You'll need to install [Bun](https://bun.sh) before contributing.

Then you can fork the repo, install the dependencies, and build the packages for the first time!

```sh
git clone {your-fork}
cd webext-core
bun i
bun run build
```

## Project Layout

The `webext-core` repo is a monorepo containing all the packages under the [`@webext-core` scope](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40webext-core).

Here's an overview of the main directories:

- `docs`: The website for <https://webext-core.aklinker1.io>
- `packages/*`: Each NPM package has it's own directory
- `packages/*-demo`: Some packages have a demo extension

Each package's README (`packages/*/README.md`) will have additional details for setting up or testing the package.

In general, all packages are the same.

- They all have a `README.md` with additional documentation
- They all use `src/index.ts` as the entrypoint
- They all use `tsup` for building the final package for NPM
- They're all written in TypeScript
- They all share the same basic scripts for common tasks

### Scripts

In the root directory, you can run the following scripts:

```sh
bun run build  # Run the build script for all packages
bun run format # Run prettier to format all your files
```

Or `cd` into a package's directory and run these scripts

```sh
bun run build   # Build the package and it's dependencies
bun run check   # Check for type errors
bun run test    # Run unit tests in watch mode
```

Each directory might have additional scripts you can run. See each `package.json` for a complete list.

## Publishing Packages

Only owners of the repo can publish a new version of the extension. But in summary: other than pressing the button, everything is automated via the "Publish Packages" GitHub action. That includes:

- Bumping the package version
- Generating release notes
- Createing a GitHub release
- Publishing to NPM

The action will run these steps for a set list of packages.

There is no way to filter or prevent a package from being publish when running this command. If there's a `feat` or `fix` unpublished for any package, it will get published. Packages without any features or fixes will be skipped.

### Commit Style

If you are submitting PRs, don't worry about this! A maintainer will squash and merge your PR with a commit message in the correct style.

Each commit's title effects the publishing process. The style is based on conventional commits, but using scoped prefixes. Use the `fix(package-name): ` and `feat(package-name): ` prefixes when commiting a change. For example, the following commit history:

```
docs: Fixed typos
fix(storage): Some change
feat(proxy-service): Some new feature
chore: Refactored scripts
```

Would result in a patch version change for `@webext-core/storage` (like from `1.2.1` &rarr; `1.2.2`), and a minor change for `@webext-core/proxy-service` (like from `1.3.4` &rarr; `1.4.0`).

### Publishing a New Package

When publishing a package for the first time, publish it by hand and create a release manually.

```sh
cd packages/package-name
pnpm publish
```

## Updating Docs

This documentation website is continuously deployed on Vercel. You do not need to run any actions or scripts to publish the docs. Just push changes to `main`.
